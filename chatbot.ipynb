I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.    How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?\n",
      "Bot: Heck , sure thing , hun ! Feelings of 'depression ' have a deeply-rooted base in physical structures that may not be functioning very well at present ; and , we can certainly turn them on again using means that you are able to find around the house and with relative ease : ) After that , emotional and spiritual support will be liberally applied .\n",

You might be remembering so many dreams because your conscious mind is ready to hear these messages ... and make some internal changes in response.Write them down ! You 'll be glad you did . A broad cross-section of these these messages will help your therapist help you interpret the meanings of these communications from you to you , and possibly chart your best path forward toward to resolve the cause of psychological symptoms you might be experiencing .\n",

Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?\n",
      "Bot: It is very common for people to have multiple issues that they want to ( and need to ) address in counseling . I have had clients ask that same question and through more exploration , there is often an underlying fear that they `` ca n't be helped '' or that they will `` be too much for their therapist . '' I do n't know if any of this rings true for you . But , most people have more than one problem in their lives and more often than not , people have numerous significant stressors in their lives . Let 's face it , life can be complicated ! Therapists are completely ready and equipped to handle all of the issues small or large that a client presents in session . Most therapists over the first couple of sessions will help you prioritize the issues you are facing so that you start addressing the issues that are causing you the most distress .

Good for you on clearly knowing your priorities.If I was sitting with you now , I 'd ask you to list your reasons.Start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further.If , for example , you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships , then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self , even when this sets you apart from your friends.If , you feel you need a man to protect you financially , then possibly you 've lost faith in your ability to financially support yourself.If you 'd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately , then you 've found the best reason for wanting a man in your life.This is far different than `` need '' .\n",
